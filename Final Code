these 2 are the final codes for the german traffic ligth system project 
1. take the file on line 6 and add it to a folder 
2. create a folder 'data' in the same folder that the file exists in
3. add the file on line 7 to the 'data' folder 
4. finally you can run file 1 which has C code in Arduino IDE and file 2 which has html,css and javascript will automatically work along side the ESP8266 microcontroller and LEDs
